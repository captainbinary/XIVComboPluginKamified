  "Changelog": "1.3.6.0:\r\n* Updates to make it more compatable and user friendly.  Added Lucid Dreaming to all.\r\n\r\n1.3.1.0:\r\n* Lance Charge to Dragon Sight/Battle Litany added. I cannot confirm how will MOAction/Redirect will work with the former, as I only use UnknownX7's ReAction.\r\n    \r\n1.3.0.8:\r\n* Leg Graze on Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix changed into Peloton, but only while you have a target.\r\n    \r\n1.3.0.7:\r\n* Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix now properly turns into Pitch-Perfect, and only when *you* can use it.\r\n    \r\n1.3.0.6:\r\n* Play to Astrodyne fixed.\r\n* Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix Feature added. Should fix the WM issue for the time being (WM itself refuses to be changed back to itself for some reason, hence 'semi-fix').\r\n    \r\n1.3.0.0: 6.1 changes.\r\n* All Kaiten-based features are removed, for what should be obvious reasons.\r\n* Jump to Mirage Dive removed (now implemented in-game).\r\n* Searing Light removed from Carby Feature.\r\n* Wanderer's to Pitch Perfect removed (now implemented in-game).\r\n* Dancer Flourish Proc Saver removed, as now the procs Flourish provides are separate from your normal combo procs.\r\n* Warrior combos to Fell Cleave removed due to changes to Inner Release. AoE functionality still the same.\r\n* Overpower combo no longer defaults to Mythril Tempest if you have no target.\r\n* Storm's Path to Storm's Eye added. Only functions if the buff isn't up, so you will still need to keep Storm's Eye on your bar for upkeep.\r\n\r\nIf a recent change isn't documented on this changelog, it is because it doesn't affect plugin functionality, or is a minor bugfix."
