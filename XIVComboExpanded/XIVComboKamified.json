  "Changelog": "1.3.6.0:
* Updates to make it more compatable and user friendly.  Added Lucid Dreaming to all.

1.3.1.0:
* Lance Charge to Dragon Sight/Battle Litany added. I cannot confirm how will MOAction/Redirect will work with the former, as I only use UnknownX7's ReAction.
    
1.3.0.8:
* Leg Graze on Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix changed into Peloton, but only while you have a target.
    
1.3.0.7:
* Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix now properly turns into Pitch-Perfect, and only when *you* can use it.
    
1.3.0.6:
* Play to Astrodyne fixed.
* Wanderer's Minuet Semi-Fix Feature added. Should fix the WM issue for the time being (WM itself refuses to be changed back to itself for some reason, hence 'semi-fix').
    
1.3.0.0: 6.1 changes.
* All Kaiten-based features are removed, for what should be obvious reasons.
* Jump to Mirage Dive removed (now implemented in-game).
* Searing Light removed from Carby Feature.
* Wanderer's to Pitch Perfect removed (now implemented in-game).
* Dancer Flourish Proc Saver removed, as now the procs Flourish provides are separate from your normal combo procs.
* Warrior combos to Fell Cleave removed due to changes to Inner Release. AoE functionality still the same.
* Overpower combo no longer defaults to Mythril Tempest if you have no target.
* Storm's Path to Storm's Eye added. Only functions if the buff isn't up, so you will still need to keep Storm's Eye on your bar for upkeep.

If a recent change isn't documented on this changelog, it is because it doesn't affect plugin functionality, or is a minor bugfix.",
